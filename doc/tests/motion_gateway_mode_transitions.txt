1. Launch all 6 processes starting with the gateway. Note the initial mode of the gateway is Home and the initial states of the bulb and motion sensor are Off and NoMotion, respectively.
2. Set the motion sensor to YesMotion, which is pushed to the gateway, which turns the bulb On.
3. From the user, set the gateway mode to Away, which then turns the bulb Off.
3. From the user, set the gateway mode to Home, which then queries the motion sensor. Since motion is still detected, the gateway turns the bulb On.

Output from the gateway:
