<!--Brief requirement-->
<hr>
<ul>

<li>You may work in groups of two for this lab assignment.</li><p></p>

<li>This project has two purposes: first to familiarize you with
concepts in fault tolerance, replication and consistency.
</li><p></p>

<li>You can be creative with this project. You are free to
use any programming languages (C, C++, Java, python, etc) and any abstractions
such as sockets, RPCs, RMIs, threads, events, etc. that might be
needed. You can also build on the code that you wrote for the previous lab if
it is convenient.
You have considerable flexibility to make appropriate design
decisions and implement them in your program.</li><p></p>

<!--The problem-->
<li>
<h3>A: The problem:  </h3><p></p>

<ul>

  <li> 


The goal of this project is to implement fault tolerance and replication
 
in the system and also consistency.

Assume that the IOT gateway implements a multi-tier architecture like 
before.

You goal is to replicate the gateway so that there are two replicas 
(each front-tier replica communicates with its own backend database tier
 replica).

Like before, the system has a number of sensors or smart devices which
are NOT replicated. A sensor or a smart device can communicate with
either gateway replica. At start-up time, design a technique to
associate each sensor or device with either replica such that the
number of devices / sensors communicating with either replica is
roughly equal.  That is, you should not hard code the address of the
gateway replica in the sensor / device but choose it dynamically at
startup time to balance the load.
<p>
It is assumed that any replica can serve any sensor / device.  the gateway 
replicas implement a consistency technique to ensure that their states (e.g., 
database states) are syncronized. You may choose any connsistency mechanism
for this purpose but be sure to clearly describe the algorithm used in your
design document and also discuss the consistency semantics provided by your chosen approach.
</p><p>
Next, implement a cache in the front-end tier to enhance performance of the
gateway.  The cache will store all recently accessed data items / query
results from the database in the in-memory cache. When the front-end tier
needs to make a request to the database tier, it should first look
in the in-memory cache to see if the results are already cached (and if so,
use it). In the event of a  cache miss, the front tier should make a 
request to the database tier like before.  Assume that the cache can 
store up to maximum <i>N</i> item (N should be configurable). Implement
a simple cache replcaement startegy such as LRU or least frequently used
policy to evict cached items when a new item needs to inserted in the cache
and the cache is full.
</p><p>

Since the cache holds copies  of certain data from the database,
you should extends your cache consistency technique to handle
replicated data items in the cache as well as that in the database replicas. 
</p><p>

Since the gateway is replicated, you should also make your gateway fault
 
tolerant. It is sufficient to handle crash faults (Byzantine faults need
not be handled). Also for simplicity, assume that the both tiers
of a gateway replicas fail at once and in this case, the other gateway
needs to take over the functions of the failed replica. 

A gateway node needs to dynamically determine the failure of the other 
replica (this can be done by any method that you choose such as 
exhanging 
"I am alive" heartbeat messages). Upon detecting a failure, the 
remaining
gateway replica implements a failure recovery algorithm thay involves 
taking over the responsibility of servicing all sensors and devices that
were communicating with the failed replica. Your failure recovery method
needs to inform the sensors / devices of the failure and have them 
reconfigure
themselves to communicate with the new replica for subsequent requests. 
While the failure recovery "algorithm" can be straightforward, clearly
document how failures are detected and all the steps your replica 
peforms
to take over the functions of the failed gateway. Also explain if 
failiures can lead to any data loss  in your system (which will depend
on the choice of your consistency mechanisms that syncronize state
between the replicas) and the impact of any such data loss.

Implement your replication, caching, cache consistency and fault 
tolerance
techniques in your code. 

This lab does not need vector, logial clocks or leader election aspects 
of lab 2
 and it is fine to simply assume that clocks are syncronized and simple 
timestamptsfor determining event ordering.


</p><p>
<b> Design for Paxos:</b> The final part of this lab requires you 
to provide a design if you were asked to implement Paxos in this sytem
(you only need to writeup a high-level design / algorithm in your Design
doc and do not need to implement the algorithm). Assume that there 
are <i>k</i> gateway replicas and that each request is sent to all 
of them and the replicas run Paxos to reach agreement on the answer
before providing a reply to a request. How might such a system work?
Explain clearly how the Paxos algorithm can be used by your gateway nodes
and you would have implemented it in your current design. Do not blindly
cut and paste thr algorithm from the class slides or from the Internet - you
are expected to gain some faimiliarity with it and come up with a design
that uses Paxos.  Provide a writeup of your design with the main
design document (no implementation is necessary to get credit for this part).

</p><p>
<b>Extra Credit:</b> This part is optional.  For extra credit,
implement your Paxos design in the gateway nodes and conduct 
simple experiment to demonstrate it works (e.g., the system functions 
even when nodes 
fail or one of the node produces an incorrent answer).






</p><h3>Requirements:</h3>
<ol>
<li>You need to implement all the mandatory parts: replication, caching,
consistency and fault tolereance  and provide a design of Paxos. 
</li><li> The extra credit part of the lab is optional.
</li></ol>




  </li><li> <b>Other requirements:</b><p></p>


       <ol>
       No GUIs are required. Simple command line interfaces and textual output of scores and medal tallies are fine.
<p>
 You are free to develop your solution on any platform, but please ensure that your
programs compile and run on the <a href="http://www-edlab.cs.umass.edu/"> edlab machines</a> (See note below).

<h3>B. Evaluation and Measurement</h3>

Deploy two gateway replicas and a few sensors

<ol>

<li> Start  your system with different numbers 
of sensors and show how your system "balances" the load from these
sensors across the two replicas.

</li><li> Conduct a series of simple experiments to demonstrate the working
of your system with and without caching. MEasure the response 
times of requests with and withotu caching and for cache hits and cache misses.
Be sure to show the impact of any cache inconsistency if you have used
a technique that does not provide strict consistency guarantees.


</li><li> Conduct simple experiments to inject a gateway failure and demonstrate
how your system recovers from the failure. Repeat your experiment by
injecting failures at different points and show that your system can
recover in each case. Meaure the time needed to detect a failure, the time
to recover from a failure once it has been detected and also show
whether the failure can cause a sensor / device push/pull messahe to get lost 
and the impact of any such loss.


<p>Make necessary timeline plots or figures to support your conclusions.</p>
