Running the programs from edlab machines

First:

source /nfs/elsrv4/users3/grad/ppegus/cs677/lab1/env.sh

This puts all 6 executables (gateway, user, smartbulb, smartoutlet, temperaturesensor, motionsensor) in your path.
It also sets up the required Go environment in case you want to compile the project.
Which you can do with:

/nfs/elsrv4/users3/grad/ppegus/cs677/lab1/compile_all.sh

The processes user, temperaturesensor, and motionsensor are interactive.
In general, it is best to run each in it's own terminal or screen whether on the same machine or distributed.
To run all processes on the same machine, enter the executable name. Nothing else is needed.
For example:

gateway

To run the processes across multiple machines, you must specify the local non-loopback IP address for the gateway, as well as the IP address of the gateway for other processes.
For example to run the gateway on 128.119.243.147 and the user on 128.119.243.164:

gateway -i 128.119.243.147
user -i 128.119.243.147 -I 128.119.243.164

All executables respond to the -h flag to document their options.
For example:

gateway -h

All interactive processes will display a prompt that requests and describes the interaction.
